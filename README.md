# dockless-scooter-location-scraper
Python script used to download the location data provided by many of the dockless scooter companies in the DC and LA area. 

I wrote this script as part of my REU at Florida Atlantic University which focused partly on using dockless scooter location data to find the ways people move with in cities. To accomplish this goal I had to get the publicly available locations of the scooters periodically. The included script does so by accessing the included CSV file and downloading the data from the API URLs every 10 minutes, which are then uploaded to Google Drive. I will upload the data I have gathered in another repo.
